# XactoClientService

Xacto Client Service is a final project for Stony Brook University's CSE 320 course. 

Xacto Client Service is a remote-accessible server that basically functions as a hashmap. Once running, clients can connect to the server and give various "get" amd "put" commands to retrieve and save values into the hashmap. After doing all necessary "get" and "put" commands, the client can then commit their changes to the server.

The client-side program is not provided.
